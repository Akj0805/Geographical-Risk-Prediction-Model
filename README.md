# Geographical-Risk-Prediction-Model
This project develops a Geographical Risk Prediction Model (GRPM) using Python, Tableau, and logistic regression to predict natural disasters like floods and landslides in India. By analyzing weather and news data, the model provides accurate, location-specific risk assessments to aid in disaster preparedness and resource allocation.
