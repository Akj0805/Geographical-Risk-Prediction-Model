# Geographical-Risk-Prediction-Model
This project aims to enhance disaster preparedness and risk management in India by developing a Geographical Risk Prediction Model (GRPM) that predicts natural disasters such as floods and landslides. Leveraging Python, Tableau, and logistic regression algorithms, the model utilizes data from weather and news sources to provide accurate, location-specific risk predictions with a user-friendly interface. The GRPM addresses data collection challenges and is designed to support authorities in making informed decisions to mitigate risks, safeguard lives, and allocate resources effectively.
